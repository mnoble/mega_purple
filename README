= MegaPurple

MegaPurple is a Rails plugin for simple and smart syntax highlighting, via Ultraviolet.

== Installation

  script/plugin install git://github.com/mnoble/mega_purple.git

== Getting Started

Set up your default settings in an initializer:

  # config/initializers/megapurple.rb
  
  MegaPurple.configure do |config|
    config.theme = "railscasts"
    config.lang = "ruby"
    config.line_numbers = false
  end

== Usage

=== Add a column for the formatted content:

Add a <tt>formatted_*</tt> column for the Ultraviolet formatted content, where the <tt>*</tt> is the name the column you're highlighting. This way you have a raw copy for using on edit pages and a formatted copy for displaying publicly.

  class AddFormattedBodyToArticle < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :articles, :formatted_body, :text
    end
    
    def self.down
      remove_column :articles, :formatted_body
    end
  end

=== Declare which attribute should be highlighted:

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    highlight :body
  end

This will format the content of that attribute and save to it's corresponding <tt>formatted_*</tt> column.

=== When submitting content to a field that will be highlighted:

  This is a blog post with a code example:
  
  <code lang="ruby_on_rails">
    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
      caches_action :index
    end
  </code>

When writing a post/article/whatever that is going to be highlighted, wrap all code blocks in <tt><code></tt> tags, like so. The <tt>lang</tt> attribute can be any languages shown when you run <tt>uv --list syntaxes</tt>.
